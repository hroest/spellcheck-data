Hunspell uses a dictionary (dic) of words and a rule set to build words (.aff).

== Affix files==

See http://www.openoffice.org/lingucomponent/affix.readme

$ man 4 hunspell

=== German affix rules === 

COMPOUNDBEGIN x
COMPOUNDMIDDLE y
COMPOUNDEND z
COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG c # Affixes with COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG may be inside of compounds.
ONLYINCOMPOUND o # only in compounds

NEEDAFFIX h # virtuals stems, only valid with affixes

m -> allows uppercase words to prepend a "-" and make lowercase
m -> allows lowercase words to prepend a "-" and make uppercase

B -> -bar / -bare / -barem ... 
U -> un-

ij -> allow prefix and suffix with -xxx and xxx-
m -> allow compound words with word in the middle
P -> allow adding -en


example:

Arbeit/Pm
arbeit/Pozm

Arbeits/hij
arbeits/hke


this will allow the word "arbeits" to be used inside a compound word. The hij scheme will make it correct as a starting word, the hke scheme as a middle compound word (but not as an end word).

=== Example ===

Affix example (see .aff):

```
PFX U Y 1
PFX U   0     un       .
```

means a prefix that is marked with "U" in the dict file, combination is
possible with other pre/suffixes (Y) and there is one line (1).
The field is the option name (PFX), the flag (U) and the stripping at
beginning/end of the word (here 0, so no stripping), then the affix (un) and finally the condition (., all).

For example, an entry in the dictionary

verwertbar/AU

where U = means that also "unverwertbar" is correct 
where A  = "-bare", "barer", "baren", "barem", "bares" are correct words.

doktorieren/DIXY

where D = "doktorierend doktorierende doktorierendem"
where I = "doktoriere"
where O = "doktoriertes doktorierten doktorierter doktoriertem" => no adjektiv!


abkapseln/DIXY
abkapseln/SJozm

where o = only in compound words
where z = use at end of compound word
where m = "-abkapselns"
where S = "abkapselns"
where J = "abkapselung Abkapselungen Abkapslung"

Stand/STmij

where S = "Stands"
where T = "Standes"

Stanz/mij
Spann/SEmij


where S = "Spanns"
where E = "Spanne"


lutschen/DIXY


also::

gefletscht/A


Stoff/EPSTmij


where E = "Stoffe"
where P = "Stoffen"
where S = "Stoffs"
where T = "Stoffes"
where m = "-stoff"  (prefix only)


zypressenwald/STozm

-> o = only in compound

Drehinversionsachse
 
needs the following:

dreh/hij
inversions/hke
achse/Nozm

where h = needs affix (wont work without an affix)
where i = -coyf     PFX
where j = xoc (onlyincompound, compoundmiddle, compoundbegin)       SFX
where k = coy (compoundpermit flag, onlyincompound, compoundmiddle) PFX
where e = yoc (compoundpermit flag, onlyincompound, compoundmiddle) SFX

-> hke does not allow it to be at the start ... 
-> hij does not allow it to be in the middle ... 

Gruppensignaturschema needs the following

Gruppen/hij
signatur/hke
schema/Nozm


Programm/EPSm
Programm/Tmij


where E = "Programme"
where P = "Programmen"
where S = "Programms"
where m = "-programm"

where T = "Programmes"
where mij = start is possible
