Affix example (see .aff):

```
PFX U Y 1
PFX U   0     un       .
```

means a prefix that is marked with "U" in the dict file, combination is
possible with other pre/suffixes (Y) and there is one line (1).
The field is the option name (PFX), the flag (U) and the stripping at
beginning/end of the word (here 0, so no stripping), then the affix (un) and finally the condition (., all).

For example, an entry in the dictionary

verwertbar/AU

where U = means that also "unverwertbar" is correct 
where A  = "-bare", "barer", "baren", "barem", "bares" are correct words.

For compound words, the definitions are i/j, e.g. 

Arbeits/hij

while h says that it needs a sort of affix (in total there are 2176 hij words in the dict that only are correct because they are compound words)

doktorieren/DIXY


where D = "doktorierend doktorierende doktorierendem"
where I = "doktoriere"
where O = "doktoriertes doktorierten doktorierter doktoriertem" => no adjektiv!


abkapseln/SJozm

where S = "Abkapselns"
where J = "Abkapselung Abkapselungen Abkapslung"
where m = "-abkapselns"


Stand/STmij

where S = "Stands"
where T = "Standes"

Stanz/mij


Spann/SEmij


where S = "Spanns"
where E = "Spanne"


lutschen/DIXY


also::

gefletscht/A


Stoff/EPSTmij


where E = "Stoffe"
where P = "Stoffen"
where S = "Stoffs"
where T = "Stoffes"
where m = "-stoff"  (prefix only)


zypressenwald/STozm

-> o = only in compound


Drehinversionsachse
 
needs the following:

dreh/hij
inversions/hke
achse/Nozm

where h = needs affix (wont work without an affix)
where i = -coyf     PFX
where j = xoc (onlyincompound, compoundmiddle, compoundbegin)       SFX
where k = coy (compoundpermit flag, onlyincompound, compoundmiddle) PFX
where e = yoc (compoundpermit flag, onlyincompound, compoundmiddle) SFX

-> hke does not allow it to be at the start ... 
-> hij does not allow it to be in the middle ... 

Gruppensignaturschema needs the following

Gruppen/hij
signatur/hke
schema/Nozm


Programm/EPSm
Programm/Tmij


where E = "Programme"
where P = "Programmen"
where S = "Programms"
where m = "-programm"

where T = "Programmes"
where mij = start is possible
